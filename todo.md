Now
---

  * implement "meta" constructs (modules/namespaces)
  * macros
  * native core functions
  * find example of cyclic refs / prove that they cant exist

Later
-----

  * write docs!
  * change the GC from simple ref counting to something cooler (boehm)
  * filepath / loading settings config
  * implement core modules like: network? file io?
  * some kind of native map?
